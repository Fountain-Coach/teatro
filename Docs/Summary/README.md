## 9. Summary

The **Teatro View Engine** is a modular, fully declarative view system written in Swift 6 for Linux environments. It enables Codex-based orchestration of semantic user interfaces, narrative compositions, animations, and musical structures.

### ✅ Key Capabilities

- **Declarative UI Views**  
  Composable `Renderable` types (`Text`, `VStack`, `Stage`, etc.) support layout, alignment, styling, and introspection.

- **Rendering Backends**  
  Multiple output targets including HTML, SVG, PNG (via Cairo), and Codex introspection.

- **CLI Integration**  
  A command-line entry point allows rendering from terminal or scriptable pipelines.

- **Timeline-Based Animation**  
  Frame-by-frame rendering of view sequences for semantic drift, transitions, and GPT step-wise thinking.

- **Music Rendering**  
  - **LilyPond:** Printable PDF sheet music from `LilyScore` views.
  - **MIDI DSL:** MIDI 2.0-style sequencing via `MIDINote`, `MIDISequence`, and `MIDIRenderer`.

- **Screenplay Rendering**  
  - `.fountain` parsing into typed screenplay elements
  - `FountainSceneView` enables GPT-authored scripts to be staged and animated

### 🧠 Codex Readiness

All parts of the Teatro View Engine are designed to be:

- Composable: All views conform to `Renderable`  
- Introspectable: Every structure has deterministic `render()` output  
- Animatable: Views can evolve across time via `Animator`  
- GPT-friendly: DSLs like `.fountain`, LilyPond, and MIDI are natively supported  
- Extensible: Each layer can be expanded (e.g. to live UI, SVG animation, SVG timelines, MIDI2 UMP, etc.)
